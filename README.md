**Dranchuk and Abu-Kasem (1975)**

The gas deviation factor (*Z*) is by definition the ratio of the volume actually occupied by a gas at a given pressure and temperature to the volume it would occupy if it behaved ideally:
$$Z=\frac{V_{actual}}{V_{ideal}}$$

*Z* can be estimated from its specific gravity. The method uses a correlation to estimate pseudocritical temperature and pseudocritical pressure values from the specific gravity. Dranchuk and Abou-Kassem fitted an EOS to the Standing and Katz data that is more convinient for estimating *Z* in computer programs. DAK is based on the generalized Starling EOS.
